# Personal Portfolio

My personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills and projects. 

This platform serves as a central hub for potential collaborators, employers, and peers to explore my work and get in touch.

## Features

- **Custom-Built Blog Engine**: Developed from the ground up, this blog engine facilitates seamless creation and management of posts as simple Markdown files. It supports Markdown formatting, syntax highlighting for code snippets and a responsive design for optimal viewing across devices. Additional features include tag filtering, estimated reading time and easily copyable code snippets.

- **Project Showcase**: A curated selection of my projects, complete with repository details fetched via GraphQL Github API with my custom case studies for each of them.
